# ChilloutVR - BetterUI

A new implementation of the ChilloutVR user interface, redesigned to be more readable and esthetic

## How to use it

First, you need to install the game. Then, you can go inside the game's folder and get to :

`<Game Directory>/ChilloutVR_Data/StreamingAssets/Cohtml/UIResources`

At this point, you should make a backup of the folder `GameUI` and you must recreate or delete it before anything else.

Then, you can download and extract the repository ZIP file, or do a `git clone https://github.com/Oxyto/ChilloutVR-BetterUI.git` to get the latest version of the mod. Once you've done that, you must put **all the content of the ZIP file** inside `GameUI` folder or rename it.
